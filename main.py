'''
Evolve Agents to recreate image over generations
their genome is going to be the shapes they have
the fitness is going to be the mean squared error from the target image (lower is better)

starting out the agents have a random circle in a random place
we can detect the color of each of the squares by adding the values of all the circles with the
color of the background without using overhead of the pygame
